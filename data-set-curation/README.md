# Quantum Chemical and Physical Property Data Set Curation

Within these directories are the scripts used to curate the experimental physical property
data sets that the vdW force field parameters were trained (`optimizations/`) and tested (`benchmarks/`) 
against, and the quantum chemical (QC) data sets that the valence parameters will be trained upon.

Instructions for curating the sets can be found in each of the sub-directories.
